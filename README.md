# Kurose Network Course Repository

This repository is centered around the curriculum provided by the textbook "Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach" by James Kurose and Keith Ross. The textbook is renowned for its reader-friendly explanation of complex networking concepts, structured from the application layer down through the transport, network, and data link layers, making it one of the most revered sources on the subject.

In this repository, I will be storing all programming assignments related to the course content. Additionally, this space will host various side projects that explore deeper networking concepts and technologies. While not guaranteed, lab reports documenting experimental findings and practical applications may also be included as they become relevant to my studies and explorations.
